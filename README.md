- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with C, python, hacking .......
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about .hmmm..ðŸ¤”..anything?

## Reducing go binaries size (shedding of extra weight) 
1. strip "unnecessary info" when building/compiling - go build -ldflags="-s -w" "/path/to/source/file"
2. Shed off extra weight from the compiled binary using upx - upx --brute "/path/to/compiled/binary" (can be applied to other binaries ??)

## Cross-Compiling
GOOS="linux" GOARCH="amd64" go build "/path/to/source/file" -- compile binary for linux amd64 machine

### Go Advantages
- cross compiling - you can compile code written in linux for a windows machine... vice-versa
- easy to learn (if you have some knowledge in programming )

# Osint
- whois lookups - find info about domains
- netcraft - whois except better and much more info
- google hacking - google dorking e.g

	site:"domain name" - only info coming from the specific domain
	filetype:xml - search for files of type "xml"
	filename:users - search for files having the name "users" 
	inurl: "index of" - search for "index of" in the url
	~~~
	**MORE can be found at exploit db**
- website recon - e.g Frameworks like recon-ng
- gitrob & gitleaks - find sensitive info in git repositories
- shodan -- find devices connected to the internet e.g
	~~~
	in search bar: hostname:"domain name" -- find open ports and devices of the specified hostname
